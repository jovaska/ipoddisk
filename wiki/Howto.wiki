= Steps =

Note that this is highly *experimental* stuff:
  * If you haven't installed [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/ MacFUSE], do it now.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/ipoddisk/downloads/list download] and install iPodDisk.app
  * plugin you iPod and make sure disk mode has been enabled
  * launch iPodDisk.app

PS: 
  * it has *not* been tested on Intel Macs.
